👋 Hi, I'm Ken  
I'm a backend engineer with a solid foundation in Python and Django — transitioning from a strong background in operations, logistics, and finance in high-growth startups like 99, Rappi, QuintoAndar, and Musa.

Today, I build APIs and backend systems to solve the same real-world problems I used to tackle on the business side — with clean, well-structured, and scalable code.
