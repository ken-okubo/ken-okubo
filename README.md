# 👋 Hi, I'm Ken

I'm a backend engineer with a solid foundation in Python and Django — transitioning from a strong background in operations, logistics, and finance in high-growth startups like 99, Rappi, QuintoAndar, and Musa.

Today, I build APIs and backend systems to solve the same real-world problems I used to tackle on the business side — with clean, well-structured, and scalable code.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript (React, TypeScript – learning)
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask, Node.js
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Athena, Metabase
- **DevOps**: Docker, Git, AWS (S3, Lambda), Keycloak
- **Other**: RESTful APIs, httpx, OAuth2, JWT, Leaflet.js
