### 👋 Hi, I'm Ken  
I'm a backend engineer focused on building APIs and backend systems — drawing on a previous background in operations, logistics, and finance at high-growth startups like 99, Rappi, and QuintoAndar.

I transitioned into software engineering in 2023 and have been working with Python, Django, and FastAPI to solve the same types of business problems I used to manage — now with clean, scalable code.
